# 🧠 Bangla Handwritten Character Detection using Custom Loss Function

This repository contains the implementation of our **undergraduate thesis project** titled  
**“Bangla Handwritten Character Detection using Custom Loss Function”**,  
submitted to the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering**,  
**American International University–Bangladesh (AIUB)** in January 2024.

## 📘 Overview
Bangla is a widely used language with a complex handwritten script, which poses challenges for accurate character recognition.  
This project explores **deep learning** and **transfer learning** techniques to improve recognition accuracy by introducing a  
**custom dynamic regularization loss function** — designed to balance model precision and generalization.

Our research aims to enhance early stopping, reduce overfitting, and improve adaptability in deep neural network training.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Develop an effective model for **Bangla handwritten character recognition**.  
- Implement a **custom loss function** with dynamic regularization for adaptive training.  
- Compare the proposed method against **Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss**.  
- Analyze model performance using various **CNN architectures**.

---

## 🧩 Methodology
### 1. Transfer Learning
We utilized pre-trained CNN models as feature extractors to enhance learning efficiency:
- **VGG16**
- **MobileNetV2**
- **ResNet50**
- **DenseNet201**
- **InceptionV3**
- **VGG19**
- **Xception**

### 2. Custom Dynamic Regularization Loss
We introduced a **Dynamic Regularization Loss Function** that modifies the regularization strength during training:
\[
\text{Total Loss} = \text{CrossEntropy}(y_{true}, y_{pred}) + \text{DynamicStrength}(t) \times L2
\]
This helps maintain a balance between **accuracy** and **generalization** through adaptive regularization.

### 3. Dataset
Bangla handwritten dataset containing isolated characters and numerals  
(pre-processed and augmented for model robustness).
